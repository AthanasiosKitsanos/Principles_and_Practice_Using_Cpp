## As for Now

**I am trying to learn how to use Qt for the next chapters**  
**I am not using the Qt Designer or any other tool, but code**  
**and at the same time I am trying to learn how to use CMake Tools too**

**Note:**  
I had help for some equations since I don't know all of them  
for example on how to create the Sinusoidal Curve

The folders where the CMakeFiles are created and the final executable with the .dll files  
will not be included to GitHub
