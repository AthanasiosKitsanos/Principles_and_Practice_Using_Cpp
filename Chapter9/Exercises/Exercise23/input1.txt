The lighthouse stood at the edge of the bay like a patient thinker, watching the water rearrange itself with
every tide. Fishermen trusted its steady pulse more than their own instincts, because light, unlike luck,
follows rules. At dawn the sea softened into glass, reflecting clouds that looked briefly organized before
dissolving again. Nothing dramatic happened, which was precisely the point: stability is often invisible when
it works.
