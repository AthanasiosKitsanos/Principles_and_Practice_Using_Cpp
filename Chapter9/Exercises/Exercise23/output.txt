The lighthouse stood at the edge of the bay like a patient thinker, watching the water rearrange itself with
every tide. Fishermen trusted its steady pulse more than their own instincts, because light, unlike luck,
follows rules. At dawn the sea softened into glass, reflecting clouds that looked briefly organized before
dissolving again. Nothing dramatic happened, which was precisely the point: stability is often invisible when
it works.

In the nearby town, mornings began with small rituals that felt older than the streets themselves. A baker
tested the air with flour-dusted hands, a bus driver counted change from yesterday, and a cat negotiated
ownership of a warm doorstep. These actions didn’t make headlines, but they stitched time together.
Progress rarely arrives as a parade; it shows up as continuity, quietly insisting that today connects to
yesterday in meaningful ways.
