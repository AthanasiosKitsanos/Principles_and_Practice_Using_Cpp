In the nearby town, mornings began with small rituals that felt older than the streets themselves. A baker
tested the air with flour-dusted hands, a bus driver counted change from yesterday, and a cat negotiated
ownership of a warm doorstep. These actions didn’t make headlines, but they stitched time together.
Progress rarely arrives as a parade; it shows up as continuity, quietly insisting that today connects to
yesterday in meaningful ways.
